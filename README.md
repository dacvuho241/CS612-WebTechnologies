- A client requests and downloads an HTML page containing an HTML form (or other
client-side programs).
- The client enters information into the form (such as search criteria), and submits these
query parameters back to a server-side program for processing.
- The server-side program extracts the query parameters, performs the database query,
and returns the query results back to the requesting client.
- The client displays the query results, and repeats the above steps for further requestresponse exchange
